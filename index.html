<p>In Mr O'Hara's Class we have done a lot of stuff this year. We have had 3 english teacher's in the last 3 years. Their names we're Mr Doyle,Ms Hickey
  and now Mr O'Hara. This year we had to read 1 play Romeo and Juliet and watch our movie Beast From The Southern Wild. We finished the movie on the 21/03/18
  it was a very good movie. There was lots of love,hate,sadness,family.leadership and respect. The story was sad they had it very tough but they
  always had family. Romeo and Juliet wasn all ab out love and family. In the end family has to end the love for good. In first and second year we learned 
  4 books they were called Private Peaceful,Wonder,The Outsiders and Mice and Men. We did a lot of oral project work like in firts year we did a project
  on a new drink we made. In second year we did our dream job and a interview/play our news report. We have not done any of that this year we have mainly 
  have done written work for our junior cert. You can click the link to watch me and kieran two students of his class interviewing him about
  being an english teacher and what its like to help his classes for junior and leaving cert. Also about his third year class 3E.</p>
